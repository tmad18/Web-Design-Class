        Hello my name is Thomas Madrid and I am from St. Louis, Missouri. I have one sister who is in college at Ole Miss and I live with my Mom and Dad. I have two dogs, one is named Marvin and the other is named Rosie. We just got them over the summer. My favorite thing to do is either play golf or go hunting. I like to deer and duck hunt during the fall and winter. I also like going to concerts. My favorite kind of music is country and I have only been to country concerts. My favorite movie is American Sniper. Some subjects I enjoy in school are Web Design and Math.
